- ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, Iâ€™m @Janani-harshu. Recently completed my Master's in Biomedical Engineering. 
I had an opportunity to work at one of the most prestigious healthcare corporations - Siemens Healthineers. 
A year-long journey has changed my perception of how healthcare is delivered globally. 
Through the interdisciplinary work on various projects, I was able to learn more about emerging technologies and innovative processes that ensure the quality and care for everyone.
(Coming from Biomed background, I had less knowlege in progrmming, as in my currcilum was structured that way)
I like to take up any challenge...and this was my turning point, where I really thought of upskilling myself and trying to contribute my knowledge in medical industry. 

- ðŸ‘€ Coding is fun! But there's a lot more to explore though :)
Always excited to learn Machine Learning, Deep Learning algorithms, digital twin, wearables, gaming, AR/VR etc. especially for improving patient's life & shaping the future of healthcare.  
- ðŸŒ± I have started with intensive ML training program... 
I will share my learnings, projects I worked on in my repos soon!! (Hope this helps for beginners like me)

Btw I am new to git too! Lol
